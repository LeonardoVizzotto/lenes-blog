description: "Why am I writing this blog"
---

If you found this you're probably wondering why this blog exists ~~because I made it of course~~, that's a great question, in fact a question so good that even I the writer don't know how to answer it but I'll try anyway.

**First of all, this is a blog about programming, so yeah I'll be talking about code and my job a lot.** 

Little background here, recently I graduated from college and became a software engineer. And what does it mean, it means that I have a degree but a degree can't do much on it's own, It doesn't make me a better developer neither a better professional and it certainly doesn't mean I should stop studying.

I had my first professional experience early in 2017 since then I've worked with a lot of different languages and frameworks (Angular.js Node Java MongoDB MySQL, JSF, Ionic the list goes on...) and it all led to this very moment where I find myself as a frontend developer working mostly with Angular 2 ~~I'm not complaining~~ . The sad reality is despite college and the technologies that I just listed I don't consider my knowledge of software engineering to be so vast as I want it to be, I mean this is the first domain I've ever bought and I have to say I had some trouble putting it up.

I see this blog as a way to keep me studying. I want to write about things I don't know yet and use it as a reference for my future self. Building it if gatsby (*which I found to be really easy*) and React ~~I know very little about it~~ was a way to push me towards this goal of keep learning new things and I'm already proud of myself. Maybe I'll write about everyday stuff too, who knows? I actually don't have any idea for the next post.

I hope this was a good introduction and that in a few days I'll have something to update here, thanks for reading.
